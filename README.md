# Stink Bubble

## Overview

This repo contains all source code and assets for the Global Game Jam 2025 game _Stink Bubble_.

The Assets/ folder contains subfolders for several third-party assets.
All first-party assets are stored in the GGJ2025/ subfolder, grouped by "feature" (player, people, etc.).
Open the scene files under `scenes/` to see how it's all put together!

The game itself is basically a 3D third-person "collection" game where you are an angry stink bug who got caught in a bubble during a party.
Take revenge by growing your bubble to create the largest stink bomb possible and ruin the party-goers' day!

To play, collect bubbles to grow yours, which is constantly shrinking over time.
The bigger your stinky bubble, the more points you'll earn when you pop in people's faces! How high will you score?

Controls:

- <kbd>WASD</kbd>: Fly within the plane
- <kbd>Space</kbd>: Fly up
- <kbd>C</kbd>: Fly down
